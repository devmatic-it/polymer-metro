            <b>System Integration.</b>
            Most of the companies consist of a wide range of different platforms and
            solutions to perform the daily work of the business. Missing integration
            of the existing solutions results in redundant information, double work and
            slower business processes. My experiences with technologies from Microsoft, SUN and IBM
            on operating systems like Windows, Linux and AIX, starting from mobile
            devices to high performance computing environments can enrich
            your ability to identify potential problems and risks. Together, we can find solutions that
            fit the high standards of your company.

            <b>Component Development.</b>
      			Professional Software products consists of a wide range of 3rd party components.
      			It is more economic to buy a ready-to-use component and integrate it into a
      			product then developing a new one from sketch. On the other hand, highly
      			specialized components can increase the customer experience and hence add a customer value.
      			Together, we can find new ways to satisfy the needs of customers and
      			enrich the customer experience.

            <b>Software Migration.</b>
            The Software industry is a fast-changing business.
            Every two years, a new operating system is created providing new technologies,
            new services and new functionalities to enrich the usability for the user.
            Most of today's commercial software solutions have a long product life-cycle. The costumer
            benefits from a stable solution, long time support and rich functionality.
            Providing new customer benefits often requires a step by step migration
            of existing products.
            As part of your team, we will focus on your vision to archieve your goals and find a way out of the technology jungle.

            <b>Consulting.</b>
          There are various ways to implement a customer oriented solution:
          Most of them have strengths and weaknesses.
          I can go towards finding better solutions by identifying the customer
          goals, providing an analysis of the existing system reality and
          summarize possible opportunities. This can reduce time to market,
          minimize possible threats and reduces conflicts in early stages of the development.
          Through my international experience, I can commit a lot to your team to respond better to cultural
          differences and to ensure a successful collaboration with foreign countries.
